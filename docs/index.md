## Basic DSP applications on FPGA

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/berkeroptoel/DSP-FPGA/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```markdown
# D/A applications

```


```markdown
# A/D applications

```

`
function [x, y, z] = cordic_rotation_kernel(x, y, z, inpLUT, n)
% Perform CORDIC rotation kernel algorithm for N iterations.
xtmp = x;
ytmp = y;
for idx = 1:n
    if z < 0
        z(:) = accumpos(z, inpLUT(idx));
        x(:) = accumpos(x, ytmp);
        y(:) = accumneg(y, xtmp);
    else
        z(:) = accumneg(z, inpLUT(idx));
        x(:) = accumneg(x, ytmp);
        y(:) = accumpos(y, xtmp);
    end
    xtmp = bitsra(x, idx); % bit-shift-right for multiply by 2^(-idx)
    ytmp = bitsra(y, idx); % bit-shift-right for multiply by 2^(-idx)
end

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/berkeroptoel/DSP-FPGA/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
